# NextJS Application Development Course

Welcome to the NextJS Application Development ! In this comprehensive application, I built powerful and performant web applications using NextJS 13, along with a variety of other technologies including Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Prisma, and Postgres. I have included dynamic routes, manage application states, implement authentication, handle global state management, and even develop a complex availability and scheduling system. Let's dive in!

## 1. File System and Routing

Discover the power of NextJS 13's file system-based routing. I have created both static and dynamic routes effortlessly by defining files and folders.

## 2. Handling Application States

Effectively manage loading, error, not found, and success states within our application. Understand the best practices for creating smooth user experiences.

## 3. Rendering Modes and Components

Understand the nuances between server-side and client-side rendering modes for React components. Learn when to use each rendering mode for optimal performance and user experience.

## 4. Server-side NextJS

Dive into the server-side of NextJS. Set up a Postgres database and define models with Prisma (ORM). Fetch data from the database based on the component's requirements to create dynamic and data-driven applications.

## 5. Authentication Implementation

Build authentication endpoints from scratch. Utilize middleware, hashers, and JSON web tokens to implement a robust authentication system that enhances the security of your application.

## 6. Global State Management

Implement user data storage using the context API. By consuming the authentication endpoints, store user data globally for seamless application-wide accessibility and state management.

## 7. Availability and Scheduling System

Conclude the course by creating a comprehensive availability and scheduling system for the application. Employ algorithms and logical thinking to achieve this complex functionality, integrating the concepts you've learned throughout the course.
